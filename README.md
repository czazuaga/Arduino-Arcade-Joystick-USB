is totally efficent, plug & play,  customizable and so easy of configure with for example the emulators.

You can repost, share,make changes or any other action.
But Please remember to mention me and put my github account.

NOTE: Now in the source code folder, are available 2 versions.
-1.0 Version is simpler and more understandable, but less efficent in response time.
